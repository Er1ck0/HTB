    2. DB Tables.
    3. DB Columns.
    4. DB Registers.

    #: 1
    To extract database name
    #: 2
    To extract tables in the database.
    #: 3
    To extract columns name in tables.
    #: 4
    To extract a specific register from a table. At this point it is recommended to enumerate it manually
    with tools such as burpsuite or by the website as long as it might cause false positives due to the 
    amount of traffic.


Keep in mind the script does not use threads so it takes some time to enumerate.
